# APA Referencer: A guideline

## About the project
Hi, this is my first Github project. Just wanted to see what I could do over the  
summer break to keep my skills up to date. Also wanted to start a portfolio for 
future internships to demonstrate my knowledge.

## Dependencies
JDK (unsure what version SPECIFICALLY, I just have v17)
Terminal (or CMD for Windows users)

## About the code.
It's pretty simple. It's a stock-standard CLI APA-style referencer. There's a 
test harness to demonstrate the "gist" of the programme. You can just run that 
via terminal if you would like to. It should generate a .txt file in the 
"output" folder.

## Running the code
Run the code via Terminal or your favourite IDE if you're lazy. The code 
operates via a simple command line menu. It's pretty intuitive and easy to 
follow; you just type in the number that corresponds to your choice.

## To-do
The italicising isn't implemented, nor the tab indentation for a "new line". An
updated version would try to incorporate those features, but it's difficult
without a GUI (esp. the italics).
